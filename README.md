Cinema ticket booking system

The Problem
Two users click "Book" on seat A1 at the same instant. Only one should win.

User A ──► read seat A1 → "free" ──► write booking ──► success
User B ──► read seat A1 → "free" ──► write booking ──► ???
Without any protection, both succeed. Now two people show up for the same seat.
